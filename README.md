A very comprehensive guide on the best Linux Distributions

**# Best of the Best:<br>**

**1. Debian:<br>**
Debian was one of the first, independent, Linux distributions to exist and has since evolved to become one of the most powerful OSes. It's nearly **"unbreakable"** as every package and component is well-tested. Even the release cycle is as long as 8 years with each being equipped with the latest software release of the time. It offers a variety of desktop environments to choose from though all use their older versions for the sake of stability. Debian Linux dominates the server market and is therefore not recommended to complete beginners. Solving malfunctions can also be a headache. However the reward of all this is rock solid stability. Here's the [Webpage](https://www.debian.org/) for the latest release of Debian, Debian 12 codenamed "BookWorm". To know the installation process and know more about the improvements that can be made i recommend watching the following videos:

**2. MX Linux:**
Another great distro that is a deriative of Debian Stable. It aims to be lightweight, provides a lot of desktop environments and various GUI tools that enable even beginners to perform system-level tasks. However i would not recommend new comers to use them, considering that many have too much power. MX Linux is great for both very old and moderate computers, and provides the latest apps (Not dependencies or packages) through flatpak support. It's also highly customizable and acts as a clone of Linux Mint. At this point you might ask yourself "What's MX's "To learn more about this amazing distro, visit their [website](https://mxlinux.org/)
