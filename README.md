#### NOTE:
This list categorizes Linux distributions based on their **primary design purpose**. While each distro is placed in the category that best represents its intended focus, **many distributions are versatile** and can be used across multiple purposes, such as development, gaming, security, or cloud deployment. Placement here reflects **what the distro was primarily designed for**, not its potential uses.
