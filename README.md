A very comprehensive guide and review on the best Linux Distributions

**# Best of the Best:<br>**

**1. Debian:<br>**
Debian was one of the first, independent, Linux distributions to exist and has since evolved to become one of the most powerful OSes. It's nearly **"unbreakable"** as every package and component is well-tested. Even the release cycle is as long as 8 years with each being equipped with the latest software release of the time. It offers a variety of desktop environments to choose from though all use their older versions for the sake of stability. Debian Linux dominates the server market and is therefore not recommended to complete beginners. Solving malfunctions can also be a headache. However the reward of all this is rock solid stability. Here's the [Webpage](https://www.debian.org/) for the latest release of Debian, Debian 12 codenamed "BookWorm". To know the installation process and know more about the improvements that can be made i recommend watching the following videos:
